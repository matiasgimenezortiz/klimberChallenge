The libraries we use in this framework are:
Selenium
TestNG
BoniGarcia (to manage drivers)
Apache Commons
aShot

All of them are already included in the pom.XML

Selenium installation is a 3 step process:

1) Install Java SDK
2) Install IntelliJ Idea (or your preferred IDE)
3) Install Selenium Webdriver Files (this one will be handled by the Boni Garcia Library)

*Installing Java SDK:
Step 1 – Install Java on your computer
Download and install the Java Software Development Kit (JDK).
This JDK version comes bundled with Java Runtime Environment (JRE), so you do not need to download and install the JRE separately.
Once installation is complete, open command prompt and type “java --version”. If you see the following message you are good to move to the next step:

"java 17.0.1 2021-10-19 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.1+12-LTS-39)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.1+12-LTS-39, mixed mode, sharing)"

The message could vary depending on the Java version installed.

*Installing IntelliJ Idea
Step1: Go to the official website https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows. And select the desired version of your choice. Here we are selecting “Community” version which is a Free and Open-Source.
